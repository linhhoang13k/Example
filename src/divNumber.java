/*
Given three integers k, l and r return the number of integers between l and r inclusive that have exactly k divisors.

It is guaranteed that l â‰¤ r.

For k = 3, l = 2 and r = 49, the output should be
divNumber(k, l, r) = 4.

We have 4 integers in that range that have exactly 3 divisors - 4, 9, 25, 49.
