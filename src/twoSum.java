Problem:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Guaranteed constraints:
 * Each input would have exactly one solution
*/

public class TwoSum {
  /*
  TwoSum method uses HashMap to store value and index together,
  and finds the sum between two indices by finding the difference between target and current value.

    Time Complexity: O(n).
      * If no such sum exists, then it goes through the whole array.
    Space Complexity: O(n).
      * HashMap stores (value, index) n times at worst case.
